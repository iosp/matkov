	ifconfig
	route -n
Once you have picked an IP address edit the /etc/network/interfaces file:

	sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

Find the line which reads iface eth0 inet dhcp and replace it with:

	iface eth0 inet static
	address 192.168.1.20
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	gateway 192.168.1.1


nmap -O

export PATH=/opt/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian/bin:$PATH
If you would like to add the compiler to the PATH permanently edit /etc/environment.

rsync local-file user@remote-host:remote-file
rsync -avz /tmp/APMrover2.build/APMrover2.elf pi@192.168.1.3:/home/pi/



	sudo ./APMrover2.elf -A udp:192.168.1.2:14550
Where 192.168.1.2 is the IP address of the GCS.
Arguments specify serial ports (TCP or UDP can be used instead of serial ports) :
    -A is for telemetry
    -B is for external GPS
    -C is for secondary telemetry

If you would like to transfer telemetry over the UART port on Navio you can specify it like this:
	sudo ./APMrover2.elf -A udp:192.168.1.2:14550 -C /dev/ttyAMA0

 

Please note that by default /dev/ttyAMA0 is used for Linux serial console, to disable it run rpi-serial-console once:
	rpi-serial-console disable


	pip install mavlink mavproxy console wp
	mavproxy.py --master 192.168.1.2:14550 --console

mv spidev_test.c ~/spi-dev/
mkdir sdfs
