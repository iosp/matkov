Aliases
alias somedir='cd /home/john/www/something/'
Then you can type somedir to go to that directory. Add these to your .bashrc.

Symbolic Links
ln -s /long/path/to/some/other/folder /shortcut
This will make a file at /shortcut which links to /long/path/to/some/other/folder. Then you can type cd /shortcut instead. The caveat of this is it fills up your root directory (or whichever directory you put the links in) pretty quick. I prefer aliases.



ls -l
sudo chown -R a: navio
sudo chmod 666 -R /navio/


If you are running linux then you can use the dd command to make a full backup of the image:
	dd if=/dev/sdx of=/path/to/image
or for compression:
	dd if=/dev/sdx | gzip > /path/to/image.gz
Where sdx is your SD card.

To restore the backup you reverse the commands:
	dd if=/path/to/image of=/dev/sdx
or when compressed:
	gzip -dc /path/to/image.gz | dd of=/dev/sdx 

sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=/home/a/raspi-python.img bs=4M
